# Vibe app
Send good vibes to your fellow students!

A simple app where you can upload and receive small positive messages. Users can upload their messages to a mongodb database.
The project uses on the frontend reactjs with typescript and nodejs with express on the backend.

The project could be extended with a live chat, where you could vibe with your homies in real time! The app currently has a placeholder chat made by one of our team-members.
Use it with your own caution as it can be used for cross-site scripting!

This is a small project for the Junction 2020 Hackathon!
