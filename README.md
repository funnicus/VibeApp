## Sustain Your Mind (SDG 3: Health and Wellbeing)
Create a solution on how to encourage learning of students while sustaining their mental wellbeing when remote education eliminates the majority of social interactions and peer reviews in the class.

Aalto University strategy is heavily based on sustainability and a concrete way for us to reach the goals set by the strategy is to use the UN's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a compass. The research by Finnish Student Health and Wellbeing Survey KOTT shows that University students are more exhausted than normal due to the COVID-19 pandemic and distant learning. Remote learning eliminates peer- review and social interactions of the classes and students are more likely to experience burnouts. Thus, Aalto University is seeking a solution to be responsible for our students and their well-being and help them. (SDG3 Health and Well-being)
The Challenge

We are looking for a solution to improve students' learning journeys during the global pandemic and the social isolation caused by the ongoing situation. Students are currently exhausted from remote learning, and their mental health might be at risk. A lot of self-direction is required of them, which is not easy for everyone.

The focus of this should not be merely sharing content, but the solution should be more about active learning, bringing in new routines and coming up with new ways to interact with others.
